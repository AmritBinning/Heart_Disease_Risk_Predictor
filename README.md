# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This repository showcases my capstone project focused on predicting the presence of heart disease based on individual responses. I obtained a real-life dataset, that had sensitive data removed ensuring that I followed ethical practices, to conduct a comprehensive analysis, develop a prediction model, and provide actionable insights.

## Project Overview

Objective: Develop a prediction model to determine the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on their responses and health attributes.

Dataset: I analysed a real-world dataset, ensuring the removal of sensitive data to protect privacy.

## Analysis and Visualization

I delved into the dataset to identify key factors associated with the presence or absence of heart disease.
Through data visualisation with libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib, I visually represented some factors that affect heart disease.

## Feature Engineering

To prepare the data for modeling, I conducted feature engineering using Pandas. This involved converting features into binary form as required for logistic regression.
I utilised mapping techniques to transform relevant features into binary representations, enabling effective modeling.

## Model Development

I divided the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
Leveraging the metrics from the SKLearn library, I evaluated my model's performance on both the training and testing data.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimise my model performance, I employed grid search to identify the best combination of hyperparameters.
Additionally, I utilised feature importance techniques to select the most influential features for predictive accuracy.

## User-Friendly Prediction

Based on lifestyle and general health inputs provided by the user, I developed a logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
Users can input their information, and the model outputs the probability of them having heart disease.

## Results and Insights

I generated a CSV file containing individuals predicted to have heart disease, along with their associated probabilities.
Similarly, I created another CSV file for individuals predicted not to have heart disease, along with their respective probability values.

## Future Steps

Some of the future steps I will take to improve upon my model is exploration of more advanced machine learning techniques to further boost my model's ability to predict if someone has heart disease or not based on their responses.
